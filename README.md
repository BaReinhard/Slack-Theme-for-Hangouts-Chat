Slack Theme for Google Hangouts Chat
====================================

This applies Slack's look and feel to your Google Hangouts Chat.
You can apply it by injecting the CSS file in the page in your browser using
an extension like Stylish for example.
Or you can put `electron.asar` in `Chat.App/Contents/Resources` to use it
in the Electron client.
